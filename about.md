About me:<br>
My name is Prajyot Chemburkar, i am a student of engineering (pursuing B.E. IT), currently in my sophomore year.
I absolutely love cybersecurity and hope to be a penetration tester someday :D<br>

What i do here:<br>
Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with thousands of people in the security field. They provide free access to various machines which are vulnerable. Your task is to gain user and root access to these machines.
Here I post writeups on how I solved some of these challenges.
