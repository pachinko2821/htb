<body>theres a quite a lot of ports open, particularly some interesting ones like winrm, smb, and ldap:<br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-1.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-1.png" /><br /><br />we enumerate smb and rpc, using enum4linux revealing creds:<br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-2.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-2.png" /><br /><br />however they dont work for marko, they do for melanie. Maybe what happens is everytime a new user is created, they are given the password "Welcome123!". They can always change their password after gaining access to their account. However, melanie was too lazy to change her password.<br /><br />This is what happens when you hire lazy sys admins :/<br /><br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-3.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-3.png" /><br /><br />user is owned. we find user ryans creds under a file in C:\PSTranscripts\<br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-4.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-4.png" /><br /><br />logging in as ryan, we find he is in dnsadmin group:<br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-5.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-5.png" /><br /><br /><br />we can use the dnsadmin to dc compromise to get root by adding a dll plugin<br />dnscmd /config /severleveldllplugin \\path\to\dll<br /><br />however it looks like the box has a anti-virus installed that blocks our dll. Use windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp encoded with x64/xor and impacket/smbserver.py to bypass the anti-virus<br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-6.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-6.png" /><br /><br />and we gain nt_authority.<br /><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-7.png" alt="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resolute/1-7.png" /><br /></body></html>
