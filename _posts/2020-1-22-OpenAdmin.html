<body><h1><b><u><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/openadmin/openadmin.png"></u></b></h1>There are only 2 ports open:<br /><img src="images/1-1.png" alt="images/1-1.png" /><br /><br />gobuster revealed dirs artwork and music. while artwork wasn't interesting, we find a login button on music that takes us to /ona dir, which happens to be running OpenNetAdmin v18.1.1, which has a RCE exploit.<br /><img src="images/1-2.png" alt="images/1-2.png" /><br /><br />using the RCE which gave me a very limited shell i uploaded a php reverse shell to get www-data, read the database config file that revealed credentials<br /><img src="images/1-3.png" alt="images/1-3.png" /><br /><br />although i couldn't actually connect to mysql with those creds, turns out user jimmy reuses his passwords<br /><img src="images/1-4.png" alt="images/1-4.png" /><br /><br /><br />however, i did not see the user.txt file in here. maybe its with the other user joanna. so i started the usual enumeration and stuff and saw there is aunusual port running on localhost<br /><img src="images/1-5.png" alt="images/1-5.png" /><br /><br />using ssh i transfered this port over to my localhost<br /><img src="images/1-6.png" alt="images/1-6.png" /><br /><br />and we see a login panel. i found the files to this page and turns out giving the correct pass will reveal joanna's ssh private key. just what we need<img src="images/1-7.png" alt="images/1-7.png" /><br /><br />reading a few more files i found a hash<br /><img src="images/1-8.png" alt="images/1-8.png" /><br /><br />so we crack the hash online (john was giving me issues idk why)<br /><img src="images/1-9.png" alt="images/1-9.png" /><br /><br />authenticate and get the private key<br /><img src="images/1-10.png" alt="images/1-10.png" /><br /><br />i cracked the key with john and the password here was ‘bloodninjas’, much like the hint given below<br /><img src="images/1-11.png" alt="images/1-11.png" /><br /><br />and we have the user.txt file. great<br /><br /><img src="images/1-12.png" alt="images/1-12.png" /><br />looks like we can open nano as sudo! if you look at the editing options nano provides, ^R is insert data from another file. i simply used that to read root.txt.<br /><br /><br /><img src="images/1-13.png" alt="images/1-13.png" /><br /><br />simple as that. hit enter and the root flag shall appear</body>
